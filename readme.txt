Description: 112 Chess is a 2 player chess game with no modifications to traditional
chess rules.

How to play: the only event functions used are onMousePress and onKeyPress. To go back 
to the menu, press m, otherwise you will only need to press your mouse or keypad to 
play the game. At the start of the game you see a menu screen, ignore the single 
player button (didn't get to it) and press the 2 player button. The player who's turn
it is is highlighted in green. If it is your turn, press on the piece that you want to
move and then press the mouse again on the square you want to move the piece to. Keep playing the game
until there is a checkmate or a stalemate. 

I did not need to install any libraries or fonts, nor are there any keyboard shortcuts.
